The Shelf source code repository includes imported snapshots of the following libraries:

autorss.py - Copyright 2002, Mark Pilgrim, licensed under the Python license.

feedparser.py - Copyright 2002-2006, Mark Pilgrim, licensed under something that looks like the 3-clause BSD licence with the no-endorsement clause removed

microformatparser.py - Copyright 2005, Phil Dawes, 'Distributed under a New BSD style license'

Given all this, Shelf needs a license. Python? Still thinking about it. Please
don't submit any patches unless you're willing to have them licensed under something
random that I think of later.
