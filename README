Shelf is an app for MacOS that looks at the current foreground application, and tries to figure out if what you’re
looking at corresponds to a person in your Address Book. Then it’ll tell you things about them.

## Using Shelf

Just run it. It’ll sit in the background, and watch the foreground application. If it can tie something you’re looking
at (the current url in your web browser, for instance, or the target of an open chat) to a person in your Address Book,
it’ll open a window and show you their name and picture, and it’ll try to fetch RSS feeds for any URLs in their address
card.

It’s possible that you don’t have a very deep address book (most people just have email addresses, the URL field is
hidden by default in Address Book.app). If you want a demo, just download my VCard file and import it. Then when you
look at this page Shelf should figure out that you’re looking at me, and show you my recent Flickr photos, blog entries,
etc.

## Building Shelf

In the root of the checkout, just run (assuming a recent macos)

    make dist

This will write out a Shelf.app in the local dist folder. Don't use the -A flag to py2app under Snow Leopard, it doesn't
work for some reason.
